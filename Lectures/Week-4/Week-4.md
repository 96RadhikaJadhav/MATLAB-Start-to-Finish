# Week 4 - Numeric vs. Symbolic
Reminder - the best place to learn MATLAB (or anything, really) is the internet! [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and MathWorks' own [MATLAB Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/)
are filled to the brim with people asking and answering questions about MATLAB. [MATLAB's own documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/) is also extensive and extremely helpful.
It includes descriptions of how to call functions as well as usage examples.
