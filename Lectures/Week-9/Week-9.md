# Week 9 - Student Led Review and Project Presentations
Reminder - the best place to learn MATLAB (or anything, really) is the internet! [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and MathWorks' own [MATLAB Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/)
are filled to the brim with people asking and answering questions about MATLAB. [MATLAB's own documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/) is also extensive and extremely helpful.
It includes descriptions of how to call functions as well as usage examples.

## Student Questions
Allow students to ask questions about their own work or previous lessons, and encourage other students to answer them. If no students answer, instructors
may then answer.

## Common Errors Encountered in the Mini-Project
Share some commonly encountered issues with completing the project. Be sure to add any good teaching examples to the repository!

## Student Presentations
Anyone who would like to present their work may do so, as long as they are prepared to answer questions with explanations.
