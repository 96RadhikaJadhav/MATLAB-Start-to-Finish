## Numeric/Symbolic Exercises
*Please remember to comment your code and label your graphs!*

1. Define the following function ​ **numerically** ​, then apply the following exercises to it
  - Evaluate the function at X = 77
  - Evaluate the function from X = 0 to X = 10

2. Define the following function, but this time ​ **symbolically** ​, then apply the following exercises.
  - Solve the function at X = 2 , Y = 4
  - Evaluate the function on the range of Y = [0, 1] with 100 points while keeping X = 1.
    - Graph the values from the previous exercise where the answer to b is your y-values going from 0=>99
