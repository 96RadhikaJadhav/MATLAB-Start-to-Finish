# MATLAB Start to Finish Curriculum

## Format
Each week there will be one short (<=30 minutes) live (and recorded) lecture given by the instructors, in which they will demonstrate 
examples and answer questions. They will then provide example problems to do outside of lecture, which can be reviewed on an individual,
 by-request basis and at the beginning of the next class. 
 
 *Student Led Review* is a class session in which students are encouraged to ask questions about homework or lecture content, and then
 encouraging other students to try and provide an answer. If no questions arise, ask some of the students and have them write solutions
 on the spot. This should be excellent for reinforcing knowledge and curating the teachers for future classes.
