# MATLAB Start to Finish
Lectures, code examples, and practice questions for teaching MATLAB for applications in undergraduate chemical engineering classes.

Included in this repository is an (approximately) 10-week curriculum intended to cover all the essentials of MATLAB, ranging from *what is the command window* up to evaluating partial differential equations symbolically.

Course taught with the support of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers at the University of Delaware.

To contribute to this repository, please provide your materials in markdown format (for lectures) or as *.m* or *.mlx* files (for MATLAB code). PDF's and and powerpoints are difficult to merge.

Markdown also enables the use of in-line syntax highlighting like this:

'''matlab
myarray = magic(5)
disp(sum(myarray))
'''
