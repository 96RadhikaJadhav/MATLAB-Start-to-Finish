# MATLAB Start to Finish
Lectures, code examples, and practice questions for teaching MATLAB for applications in undergraduate chemical engineering classes. This course assumes a functional
understanding of coding and draws heavily on a analogy to Python, so any introductory programming class should be sufficient to set you up for this course. Students, as you complete
the sample exercises or write MATLAB code relevant to the lessons, feel free to add to the repository via a pull request so that others can learn from your work!

Included in this repository is an (approximately) 10-week curriculum intended to cover all the essentials of MATLAB, ranging from *"what is the command window?"* up to evaluating partial differential equations symbolically.

Course taught with the support of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers at the University of Delaware.

To contribute to this repository, please provide your materials in markdown format (for lectures) or as *.m* or *.mlx* files (for MATLAB code). PDF's and PowerPoints are difficult to merge.

Markdown also enables the use of in-line syntax highlighting like this:

```matlab
myarray = magic(5)
disp(sum(myarray))
```
